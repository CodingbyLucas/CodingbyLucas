### Hi there 👋

I am versitile in my learning, ambitious to continue. My learning envelops my work. I am for hire, also open to collaboration or study session. I will gladly get to know more professionals and hobbiest in the web space. My skills with Shopify, HTML, and CSS are more than adequate for most needed works and Liquid program language and Javascript I am actively studying. By 2023 I plan to be well versed with Javascript and its partner React, Liquid Language, Blockchain Solidity language, Ruby on Rails, and .Net programming. I am available on Upwork and have a LinkdIn as well.

Ask me about my very interesting background and how I got into technology.
I would like to know more peoples around the world stories on what brought them to learn to code and work in technology.

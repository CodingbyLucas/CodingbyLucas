### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am versitile in my learning, ambitious to continue. If anyone would like to collaborate or study session let me know. I will gladly get to know more professionals and hobbiest in the web space. Currently I have beginner knowledge in html and css on a professional tier. My skills with Shopify are more than adequate for most needed works and Liquid program language and Javascript I am actively studying. By 2023 I plan to be well versed with Javascript and its partner React, Liquid Language, Blockchain Solidity language, Ruby on Rails, and .Net programming. I am available on Upwork and have a LinkdIn as well.

Ask me about my very interesting background and how I got into technology.
I would like to know more peoples around the world stories on what brought them to learn to code and work in technology.
